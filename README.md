# To-do list app by using React JS

In this project, I created my first app using React JS.

## The logic

1. When new text is written into the input, its state should be saved.
2. When the add button is pressed, the current data in the input should be added to an array.
3. The `<ul>` should display all the array items as `<li>s`
